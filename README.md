✅ This is Public Repository.


Repository and Branch Setup
First, I created a public repository on GitHub.
By default, the repository was created with the main branch.
After that, I created a new branch named dev for development work.
I then switched from the main branch to the dev branch and continued all development changes in the dev branch.
This helps to keep the main branch stable and use the dev branch for active development.

🔒 Private Repository Setup and Dev Branch Workflow


I created a private repository on GitHub and cloned it to my local machine.
After cloning the repository, I created a new branch named dev and switched to it for development work.

In the dev branch, I added a few files such as index.html and updated the README.md file.
I committed the changes in multiple commits to track progress clearly.
After making at least two commits, I pushed the dev branch to GitHub.

This workflow helps in maintaining proper version control and separates development work from the main branch.
