[1] This is Public Repository.
Repository and Branch Setup
First, I created a public repository on GitHub.
By default, the repository was created with the main branch.
After that, I created a new branch named dev for development work.
I then switched from the main branch to the dev branch and continued all development changes in the dev branch.
This helps to keep the main branch stable and use the dev branch for active development.
